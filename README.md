## Tasks

Feel free to create new files to help you complete these tasks.

1. Navigate to server folder run yarn then yarn start

2. Consume the data from http://localhost:8765/event endpoint.

3. Create a "widget" to display both event data and the bets that come with it using the wireframe below
   _. Each row is a bet, the columns reflect the bet offered by a specific bookie
   _. No mobile wireframe is provided as we would like to see a solution you may come up with

4. Bets that are suspended should not be displayed on the grid.

5. The bet with the best odds decimal should stand out so the user knows this bet is the best one

6. When clicking on a bet, a betslip should open and allow the user to input a stake. When the user presses bet, they should be notified of their stake and how much the potential winnings are. A wireframe is provided below.

It is important to note that this does not need to be completed. We are looking at how you approach things
